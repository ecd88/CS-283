1. How does the remote client determine when a command's output is fully received from the server, and what techniques can be used to handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission?

The remote client detects the end of a command's output by looking for a designated EOF character (0x04) appended by the server. Techniques to handle partial reads include continuously calling recv() until the EOF is detected, using buffering to store incoming data, employing message framing (sending message length first), and implementing timeouts and retries for reliability.

2. Since TCP does not preserve message boundaries, how should a networked shell protocol define and detect the beginning and end of a command sent over a TCP connection? What challenges arise if this is not handled correctly?

The dsh protocol uses an EOF character to mark the end of messages. Without clear boundaries, issues like message fragmentation, concatenation, or partial processing can occur, leading to data loss or incorrect command execution. Defining explicit message delimiters ensures reliable data parsing and command processing.

3. Describe the general differences between stateful and stateless protocols.

Stateful protocols (like TCP) retain session information across requests, allowing continuity and context-aware interactions. Stateless protocols (like HTTP and UDP) treat each request as independent, with no memory of previous interactions, resulting in simpler and more scalable designs.

4. If UDP is unreliable, why would we use it?

UDP is preferred for applications needing low latency, such as gaming, video conferencing, or real-time data streaming. It is also efficient for broadcasting, multicasting, and simple protocols like DNS, where occasional data loss is acceptable and minimal overhead is prioritized.

5. What interface/abstraction is provided by the operating system to enable applications to use network communications?

The socket API provides an abstraction for network communication, enabling applications to establish connections, send, and receive data over protocols like TCP and UDP, simplifying the complexities of network interactions for developers.
